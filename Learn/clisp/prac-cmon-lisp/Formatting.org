** Proper Indentation
indentation should reflect the structure of the code
so that counting parenthesis is not necessary
each new level of nesting gets indented a bit more
if line breaks are necessary, items at the same level are lined up
#+begin_src lisp
  (som-function arg-with-a-long-name
                another-arg-with-an-even-longer-name)
#+end_src

this along with rest of the stuff is handled by the lisp environment


** Closing parentheses
are always put on the same line as the last element of the list they are closing.

** Comments
;;;; four for file headers

;;; three for paragraph comments that applies to a large
;;; section of code

;; two for code that follows

; one for this line
