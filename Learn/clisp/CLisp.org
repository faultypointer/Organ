#+title: Learning Common Lisp

* Why?
I just recently started to learn/use (albeit much slowly) emacs. And with emacs comes elisp for configuration
stuff. So I asked why not learn lisp while we are at it.

But that is not the only or even the most significant reason. I wanted to learn a functional programming
language for quite some time. I have tried (for just a bit) haskell and ocaml previously. Somehow
I couldn't stick with any one of them. I thought what harm will it do to give change to a third one and so
for nothing. Infact I'm quite liking lisp. and who knows maybe I'll even learn to love macros?

* How?
At the moment, I'm just following the book [[https://gigamonkeys.com/book/][Practical Common Lisp]] by /Peter Seibel/.
